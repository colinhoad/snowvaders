# Flicker-Free Snowvaders
Flicker-free version of Martin Hollis' BBC BASIC Snowvaders game

# Why
The original Snowvaders game is a lovely example of a BBC BASIC space invaders style game with a festive twist. Unfortunately, the method employed for animating the snowvaders themselves is a bit hard on the eyes and somewhat migraine-inducing after more than a couple of minutes of play. This version smooths out the animation (as much as possible within the limits of BBC BASIC) to make it a more playable game.
