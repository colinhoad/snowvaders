# Flicker-Free Snowvaders
Flicker-free version of Martin Hollis' BBC BASIC Snowvaders game

# Why
The original Snowvaders game is a lovely example of a BBC BASIC space invaders style game with a festive twist. Unfortunately, the method employed for animating the snowvaders themselves is a bit hard on the eyes and somewhat migraine-inducing after more than a couple of minutes of play. This version smooths out the animation (as much as possible within the limits of BBC BASIC) to make it a more playable game.

# How
You can download the .bas file (original or hacked version) to look at and run the code directly. Alternatively, you can just download the .ssd disc image and this will work on a Beeb or Beeb emulator using the standard SHIFT+BREAK to load and run it.
